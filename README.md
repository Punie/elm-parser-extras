# Parser Extras

This library provide useful combinators for working with the elm/parser library such as parsing expression between parentheses, braces, brackets or any other symbols.

It provides also a module for painlessly building expression parsers with prefix, postfix or infix operators, handling precedence and associativity.

The Parser.Expression part of this library is heavily inspired by Haskell's `Text.Parsec.Expr` module.
